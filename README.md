# ADI-CodeQuotient
This is the repo for the codes that I did while doing this course of ADI (Algorithm Design Implementation) in my BE CS degree. All the codes in java.

[2. Challenges To Find First Occurrence](https://github.com/YuvrajxChopra/ADI-CodeQuotient/blob/main/Binary%20Search/soveChallenges.java)
[3. Solve Challenges To Win The Game](https://github.com/YuvrajxChopra/ADI-CodeQuotient/blob/main/Binary%20Search/solveChallenges2.java)
[4. Students standing in a line]()
[5. Integer Square Root](https://github.com/YuvrajxChopra/ADI-CodeQuotient/blob/main/Binary%20Search/sqrt.java)
[6. Search element in a rotated sorted array](https://github.com/YuvrajxChopra/ADI-CodeQuotient/blob/main/Binary%20Search/searchRotatedSortedArray.java)
